## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned

I've applied what I've learned with Tailwind in my first project, so it's all new to me.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#hover-focus-and-active) - The only resource I used is the official Tailwind documentation.
